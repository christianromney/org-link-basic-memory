* Testing memory:// links

This file demonstrates the org-memory-link integration with Basic Memory.

** Test Link

Here's a link to the Distributed Tracing note:
[[memory://homepage-platform/distributed-tracing][Distributed Tracing]]

To test:
1. Load org-memory-link.el in Emacs: ~(load-file "./org-memory-link.el")~
2. Click the link above (or use ~C-c C-o~ on it)
3. The markdown file should open in Emacs

** How to Create Links

1. Visit a Basic Memory markdown file (e.g., tracing.md)
2. Run ~M-x org-store-link~ (usually bound to ~C-c l~)
3. Return to an org file
4. Run ~M-x org-insert-link~ (usually bound to ~C-c C-l~)
5. Select the stored link

The link will be created using the permalink from the file's frontmatter.
